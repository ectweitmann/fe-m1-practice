1. Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
  - **Border**: every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels
    wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
  - **Margin**: margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set teh width of a margin to
    create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
  - **Padding**: padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.
    Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
2. 1px = top, 2px = right, 5px = bottom, 10px = left.
3. The differnce between **block-level** and **inline elements**:
  - **Block-level elements**: start on anew line and act as the manin building bkocks of any layout.
    (e.g. `<h1>`, `<p`, `<ul>`, `<li>`).
  - **Inline Elements**: flow in between syrrounding text. (e.g. `<img>`, `<b>`, `i`).
4. The role of **fixed positioning** is to position the element(s) in relation to the browser window,
   as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when theuser scrolls up or down the page.
  - When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The **z-index** property allows you
    to control which box appears on top.
5. A **fixed layout** does not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their
   browser window. (Measurements tend to be given in pixels). On the other hand, a **liquid layout** stretchs and contracts as the user increases or decreases the size of their brwoser window. (They tend to use percentages).
