1. To create structure.
2. **Elements**: tell the browser something about the information that
   sits between its opening and closing
   **tags** (e.g. `<h1> <h1/>` _h1_ is an example of an HTML **element**).
   **Tags**: encompass HTML **elements**, they act like containers. They tell you something about the
  information that lies between their opening and closing **tags**. (in the example above ^^ the opening **tag** is `<h1>` and the closing tag is`</h1>`)
3. **Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of
   an element.
  - They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of _two parts_: a **name** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign.
    - The **attribute name** indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. `// It should be written in lowercase`
    - The **value** is the information or setting for the attribute. `// It should be placed in double quotes`
4. `<head>`: contains information _about_ the page. `// You will   
   usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element`
   `<title>`: the contents of this element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit **OR** on the tab for that page.
   `<body>`: everything inside the element is shown inside the main browser window.
5. Click 'View' -> 'Developer' -> 'View Source'
6. `<h1></h>` (Main heading), `<p></p>` (paragraph), `<b></b>` (bold
   text),  `<i></i>` (italicize text),  `<sup></sup>` (superscript), `<sub></sub>` (subscript), `<br />` (line breaks), `<hr />` (horizontal rule),
7. **Empty Elements**: do not have any words between an opening and
   closing tag. Usually only has one tag and
   before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character.
8. **Semantic Markup**: text elements that are not intended to affect
   the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages.
9. `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
