1. To create structure.
2.
- **Elements**: tell the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing **tags** (e.g. `<h1> <h1/>` h1 is an example of an HTML **element**).
- **Tags**: encompass HTML **elements**, they act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing **tags**. (in the example above ^^ the opening **tag** is **<h1>** and the closing tag is **</h1>**)
3. **Attributes** provide additional information about the contents of an element.
  - They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of _two parts_: a **name** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign.
    - The **attribute name** indicates what kind of extra information you are supplying about the element's content. `// It should be written in lowercase`
    - The **value** is the information or setting for the attribute. `// It should be placed in double quotes`
4. **<head>**: contains information _about_ the page. `// You will usually find a <title> element inside the <head> element`
   **<title>**: the contents of this element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit **OR** on the tab for that page.
   **<body>**: everything inside the element is shown inside the main browser window.
